This is a test file.
It works. I'm very happy.
I think git is very good.
Now I'll check what I can
do next.

Sometime if you want to learn
something, you must keep patient
and do some real useful job, not
just search on the internet and
brower the page carelessly.
It may be fast to get the information
you need, but if you don't understant
why it works, you will still need
search on the internet, and do the
same job again and again, you even
don't realize it.
